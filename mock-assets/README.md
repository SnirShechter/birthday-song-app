# Mock Assets

This directory contains pre-recorded mock audio and video files for the demo.

## Songs

Place MP3 files in `songs/`:
- `preview-pop.mp3` — 10s pop preview
- `preview-rap.mp3` — 10s rap preview
- `preview-mizrachi.mp3` — 10s mizrachi preview
- `full-song-pop.mp3` — Full 2-min pop song

For the demo, these files are optional. The app will simulate audio playback
with a timer-based progress bar if actual files are not present.

## Videos

Place MP4 files in `videos/`:
- `demo-video.mp4` — 30s birthday video demo

## Generating Mock Assets

You can generate mock audio using:
1. Suno's free tier (suno.com)
2. Any royalty-free birthday song from freesound.org
3. Text-to-speech as a placeholder

For video, any short birthday-themed clip works.
